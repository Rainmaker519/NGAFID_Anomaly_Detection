# NGAFID_Anomaly_Detection

<h1> Our Project
</h1>

<p> Our project attempts to implement several versions of multivariate anomaly detection for NGAFID flight data. Currently we are working on three seperate implementations, and two are able to be run to get some result.

<h2> Running our code
</h2>
<p> At the moment the only code that runs is some demo code working as a proof of concept. For Chenliang's code, you just need to run the demo file, the Jupyter Notebook file will display better graphs.
